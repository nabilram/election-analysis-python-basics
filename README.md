## Overview of Election Audit
* Client is Colorado State and is asking for an automated election audit using Python
* Deliverables outputs include:
    * Metrics on winning candidate: raw votes and percentage
    * Metrucs on voting count per county: raw votes and percentage
    * Outputs requested in .py format (for terminal applicability) and .txt (for plain text)
* Relevant Files
    * Client input files is found here:
    * Output .py file is found here:
    * Output .txt files is found here.

## Results of Election Audit

### Overall Vote Count
* A total of 369,711 voters were casted from the 3 counties

* CANDIDATE RESULT: Diana DeGette won with 73.8% of the votes, 272892 people voted for them

## Summary and Futher Application
* Scaling up the code to accomodate wider scope (more counties, or even more states) is possible
    * Application to more counties in next electoral cycle is advised for quality electoral checks and balances
* Additional features and data points may assist the client in their efforts to increase voter turn out outside of Denver
    * Data points on voter's gender, ethnicity, age, and others will yield better voter-based analytics

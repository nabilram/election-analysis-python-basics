##LOOPING

##for loop, as long as value is in list
#for county in counties:
#    print(county)

##while loop, set to a value threshold
#x = 0
#while x <= 5:
#    print(x)
#       x = x + 1

# #using "range" for looping inside the list
# for i in range(len(counties)):
#    print(counties[i])
# # i is used in the index here, the value inside range is the length count of items in counties (number of items in counties)

##---- PRACTICE
#libraries, data comes in key:value pairs
# counties_dict = {"Arapahoe": 422829, "Denver": 463353, "Jefferson": 432438}

# 2 Ways to get KEYS
# for county in counties_dict:
#     print(county)
# same as keys() - example
# for county in counties_dict.keys():
#     print(county)

# # Way to get VALUES
# for voters in counties_dict.values():
#     print(voters)

# # Way to get BOTH KEYS AND VALUES
# for county, voters in counties_dict.items():
#     print(f"The county of {county} has {voters} registered voters.")

# Pull Dictionaries out of list of dictionaries using for loops 
# voting_data = [{"county":"Arapahoe", "registered_voters": 422829},
#                 {"county":"Denver", "registered_voters": 463353},
#                 {"county":"Jefferson", "registered_voters": 432438}]

# for county_d in voting_data:
#     print(county_d)
# # try doing the same using RANGE

# for i in range(len(voting_data)):
#     print (i)

# # using nested for loop just to get values or keys or both
# for county_dict in voting_data:
#     for value in county_dict.values():
#         print(value)

# #getting the values of specific keys
# for county_dict in voting_data:
#     print(county_dict["registered_voters"])

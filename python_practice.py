##LOOPING

##for loop, as long as value is in list
#for county in counties:
#    print(county)

##while loop, set to a value threshold
#x = 0
#while x <= 5:
#    print(x)
#       x = x + 1

# #using "range" for looping inside the list
# for i in range(len(counties)):
#    print(counties[i])
# # i is used in the index here, the value inside range is the length count of items in counties (number of items in counties)

##---- PRACTICE
#libraries, data comes in key:value pairs
counties_dict = {"Arapahoe": 422829, "Denver": 463353, "Jefferson": 432438}

# 2 Ways to get KEYS
# for county in counties_dict:
#     print(county)
# same as keys() - example
for county in counties_dict.keys():
    print(county)

# Way to get VALUES
for voters in counties_dict.values():
    print(voters)

# Way to get BOTH KEYS AND VALUES
for county, voters in counties_dict.items():
    print(f"The county of {county} has {voters} registered voters.")
